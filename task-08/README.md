# Introduction:

As I like both **movies** and **programming** , The task of making a CLI app to download the subtitles of a movie which was given by the user. I was very exciting 
to combine my passion for technology and my love for cinema. In this project, My aim is to develop an app to enable users todownload the subtitles that they own.

# Technical Details:

I have started by reserching about the libraries in python on which I should be using in developing this app.I have found that I need to use the following libraries 
**click,** **hashlib,** **imdb,** **requests,** **beautifullSoap4,** **os.**  With help of these all libraries I was able to create a simple CLI app which will accept 
an mp4 file as input and returns an list of available subtitles in the **opensubtitles.com**.This app can prompts the user to select the desired subtitle file form 
the list of the subtitles which was returned by **app**. The user can also select the language that he/she wants to download. This app will aslo handles the case 
where no subtitles was found in the website,by sending the user with the apropriate message.

# Thoughts and Experience:

I am very satisfied on working on this project. This project allowed me to eplore new libraries,And to featch the data form APIs, and improve my skills on building 
CLI apps. It was exciting to create something that would make it easier for movie lovers like Captain Jack Sparrow to locate subtitles for their favourite movies.

I had difficulties with the project, like managing edge cases and making sure the user experience was pleasant. But with patience and determination, I was able to get 
beyond these obstacles and produce a useful program that accomplished its goal.

All in all, this project served as a reminder of the ability of programming to streamline everyday tasks and offer answers for common issues. I had a great time working 
on it, and it was also really helpful.I'm excited to work on more projects that will develop my programming abilities and bring together my interests. 

In conclusion, the task I enjoyed working on the most was developing a **CLI application** to retrieve movie subtitles. It gave me the chance to merge my love of 
coding with my enthusiasm for movies, and the outcome was a project that was satisfying and fun. I believe that movie fans like **Captain Jack Sparrow** will find 
this software useful and that it will enhance their enjoyment of watching films!
