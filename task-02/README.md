# My Approach --
# Part-1
I followed the cules provided in the repository to finish this section. Initially, I discovered that I needed to look for **parchment.txt** within the Eolian Caves. To do this, I first ran the shell and Python scripts that I found when I entered the "Eolian Caves" directory. The output I received looked like this screenshot.

I then used the **Find** command to locate the parchment.txt file's path, and I went to that directory to obtain the code.

#Part-2
I've never been so furious before. First I have changed my bracnh to the **Light Realm** using git checkout

In order to identify the filenames that includes both **"good"** and **"holy"**. I have searched through every directory and used the grep command to view every text file there.

I now have two filenames, and I made the holy spell myself by using these filenames and the hints in the repository.
While I am searching the filenames I have went through a directory and discovered a Python program there. After running the Python file, I entered the holy spell, opened the light book, and obtained the code.
