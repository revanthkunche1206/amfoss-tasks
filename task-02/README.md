# My Approach --
# Part-1
I followed the cules provided in the repository to finish this section. Initially, I discovered that I needed to look for **parchment.txt** within the Eolian Caves. To do this, I first ran the shell and Python scripts that I found when I entered the "Eolian Caves" directory. The output I received looked like this screenshot.

I then used the **Find** command to locate the parchment.txt file's path, and I went to that directory to obtain the code.
