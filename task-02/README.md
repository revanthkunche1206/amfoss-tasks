# My Approach --
# Part-1
I followed the cules provided in the repository to finish this section. Initially, I discovered that I needed to look for **parchment.txt** within the Eolian Caves. To do this, I first ran the shell and Python scripts that I found when I entered the "Eolian Caves" directory. The output I received looked like this screenshot.

I then used the **Find** command to locate the parchment.txt file's path, and I went to that directory to obtain the code.

# Part-2
I've never been so furious before. First I have changed my bracnh to the **Light Realm** using git checkout

In order to identify the filenames that includes both **"good"** and **"holy"**. I have searched through every directory and used the grep command to view every text file there.

I now have two filenames, and I made the holy spell myself by using these filenames and the hints in the repository.
While I am searching the filenames I have went through a directory and discovered a Python program there. After running the Python file, I entered the holy spell, opened the light book, and obtained the code.

# Part-3 

For this part initially I have changed my branch to the **Dark Realm 1**. And used the holly light magic to disperse it and uncover the secrets which was found in the part-2 and got the code of **chest1** and **chest2**

# Part-4

I combined all four of the codes in the correct order to decode the codes I had from the previous three parts, and I was able to determine that I needed to use a **base64** decoder after seeing the hint. I have a link to the github repository after I have decoded the code.

# Part-5
Using the github link I was provided in the previous section, I opened the repository and saw that I needed to review its commits. I discovered the machine's coordinates and code when I looked at the commits in the third commit.After decoding the code I discovered, I obtained a link to another repository. There is a Python file in that repository. When I run that Python file, I receive the final message.
